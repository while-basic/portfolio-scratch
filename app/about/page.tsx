        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
          I am a mechatronic technologist and software developer, where I work on industrial manufacturing equipment,
          software, and web development. Before my obsession with technology, I was primarily focused on music
          production. During COVID-19, I distributed my first album on streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify. In
          my spare time, I enjoy investing in learning new things, building web apps, and further expanding my ideas. I am
          particularly interested in complex projects with artificial intelligence, virtual reality, industrial manufacturing, data
          centers, and blockchain technology. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet,
          please feel free to get in touch.
