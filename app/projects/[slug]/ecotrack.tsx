    description: 'A sustainability tracking application that helps users monitor and reduce their carbon footprint.',
    introduction: `EcoTrack is a comprehensive sustainability tracking platform that empowers individuals 
    and organizations to understand and reduce their environmental impact through data-driven insights 
    and actionable recommendations.`,
    
    background: `With growing concerns about climate change and environmental sustainability, there's 
    an increasing need for tools that can help people make informed decisions about their environmental 
    impact. EcoTrack was developed to bridge the gap between environmental awareness and actionable steps 
    toward sustainability.`,
    
    useCase: `Users can track their daily activities such as transportation choices, energy consumption, 
    and purchasing decisions. The application calculates their carbon footprint, provides personalized 
    recommendations for reduction, and allows users to set and track environmental goals. Organizations 
    can use the platform to monitor their corporate sustainability initiatives and engage employees in 
    environmental programs.`,
    
    inspiration: `The inspiration for EcoTrack came from the realization that while many people want to 
    live more sustainably, they often lack the tools and information to make informed decisions. The 
    project aims to make environmental impact tracking accessible and actionable for everyone.`,
