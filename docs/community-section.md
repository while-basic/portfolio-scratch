Instructions for AI: Generating a Community Section for Sharing and Viewing User-Generated Images

Objective: Create a user-friendly community section that allows users to share and view images, including AI-generated content starting with creating a new navlink titled "Gallery".

1. Define the Structure

	•	Title: Add a clear section title (e.g., “Community Gallery”).
	•	Categories: Create categories for sorting images (e.g., “Most Popular,” “Recent Uploads,” “By Style/Theme”).
	•	User Contribution Panel: Include a button for users to share their images or link AI-generated content.


2. Implement Image Display

	•	Grid Layout:
	•	Use a responsive layout (e.g., CSS Grid) for optimal viewing on all screen sizes.
	•	Support image aspect ratios with object-fit: cover.
	•	Hover Effects:
	•	Show details (username, likes, upload date) on hover.
	•	Lazy Loading:
	•	Implement lazy loading for faster performance.

3. User Interaction Features

	•	Like and Comment:
	•	Add a “like” button with a counter for popularity tracking.
	•	Include a comment section for discussions and feedback.
	•	Share Options:
	•	Provide social media sharing buttons (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn).
	•	Add a “Copy Link” button for easy sharing.

4. Upload and Moderation

	•	Upload Process:
	•	Add an upload form allowing users to submit their images with optional captions and tags.
	•	Allow direct submission of AI-generated images created within the platform.
	•	Moderation Tools:
	•	Implement basic moderation checks:
	•	Ensure uploaded content is appropriate (e.g., AI-based content review or manual approval).
	•	Enforce file size and format limits (e.g., max 5 MB, only JPEG/PNG/WebP).

5. User Profiles

	•	Attribution:
	•	Link each image to the uploader’s profile.
	•	Display user stats (e.g., total uploads, likes received).
	•	Profile Links:
	•	Provide a “View Profile” option to explore more content by the user.

6. Community Engagement

	•	Trending Section:
	•	Highlight trending images based on likes or comments.
	•	Featured Creators:
	•	Spotlight contributors with exceptional content weekly or monthly.
	•	Challenges or Themes:
	•	Introduce periodic challenges to encourage participation (e.g., “Best Winter Scene”).

7. Accessibility

	•	Alt Text: Require alt text for all uploaded images for accessibility and SEO.
	•	Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all sections are navigable using a keyboard.
	•	Responsive Design: Optimize layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

8. Backend Requirements

	•	Database Setup:
	•	Store user images, captions, tags, likes, and comments in a database.
	•	API Design:
	•	Create RESTful endpoints for fetching images, submitting uploads, liking posts, and posting comments.
	•	Security:
	•	Sanitize user inputs (e.g., captions and comments) to prevent XSS attacks.
	•	Authenticate users before allowing uploads or interactions.

9. Frontend Features

	•	Pagination or Infinite Scroll:
	•	Load images in batches for smoother performance.
	•	Dynamic Updates:
	•	Use WebSockets or polling to update likes/comments in real-time.

10. Testing

	•	Test the community section for:
	•	Load times and performance.
	•	Responsiveness on various devices.
	•	Edge cases for uploads (e.g., large files, unsupported formats).
	•	Security vulnerabilities.
